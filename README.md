# APCSA Freedom Project
by **Selina Li**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for AP Computer Science A is a year-long project all about making anything using technology.

For my project, I chose to independently study **Flutter** in order to help me make **a to-do list app**.

* impacts individuals because people can organize their own tasks
* impacts relationships because people can share their to-do list easily with others through an app
* impacts jobs because there is an increase in jobs where people code their own app
* has finanical impacts because many can gain money by making apps

##### CONS
* impacts culture because it may cause people to be too focused on their phones, which can lead to negative health effects
