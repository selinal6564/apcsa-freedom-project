The tool that I have decided on is [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). I have decided on this tool because I wanted to make an app and Flutter is used to help create apps. I have tinkered with Flutter so far by reading the documentation on the Flutter website and learning some of its concepts before I start coding. I'm currently learning how a layout of an app should work and how I could add different things, like text and images to the layout.

Before I decided on my tool, I also had other tools in mind. I was also thinking about using [GDevelop](https://gdevelop.io/) because initially, I wasn't sure if I wanted to create a game or an app. Another tool that I also considered was [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) because Swift can also used to create apps. Ultimately, I decided on Flutter because on Flutter, I'll be able to create the same app on different types of platform, so that more people would be able to accesss it. With Flutter, I plan on making either a game app or a planning app.

I am currently on **Stage 1: Define the problem** of the Engineering Design Process because in this stage, I am currently deciding what I want to make and which tool I would use to make it. For the next stage, I plan to tinker more with my tool and learn more concepts, in order to make my app.

One skill that I grew in is **consideration** because I had to consider what I wanted to make, but also had consider the best tool for making it. Another skill that I grew in is **how to read** because I had to read through the documentation. This was a little challenging for me because at first, I didn't understand what some of the code meant, since I'm learning a new tool. For example, I didn't understand the code for aligining the images because it looked different to me, so it wasn't until I read the documentation a few times that I finally understood the concept better.
