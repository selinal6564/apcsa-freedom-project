I have been learning my tool, **Flutter**, by reading through the [documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout/tutorial) and learning along the way to create a small layout. For my layout, I have added a heading and am working on aligning it, adding padding and finding different ways to display the title. I also watched a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABmqtI7ec7E&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jLYyp2Aoh6hcWuxFDX6PBJ&index=9) about creating buttons in Flutter to help me add a button to my layout. At first, I didn't understand how to add text inside a button. After watching the video, I realized that a child property is needed to add text inside the button. So I added `child: Text('button'),`.

I plan to trying to add an image to my layout and I also want to start creating my MVP.

I am currently on **Stage 2: Research the problem** and **Stage 3: Brainstorm possible solutions** of the Engineering Design Process, where I am still learning my tool, but also starting to apply what I learned and tinkering with it to see what I would like to include in my MVP. For the next stage, I plan to continue learning my tool and start planing for my MVP.

One skill that I grew in is **how to learn** because I am still learning new concepts for my tool and figuring how I would use it for my project. Another skill that I grew in is **growth mindset** because since I'm learning a new tool, there are many things that I don't know. I learned that it's important to be patient and that it's okay to spend more time on a concept that I may not understand at first, just like how I didn't understand how to add text to the button.
