# Entry 4
##### 3/17/24

I have been learning my tool, **Flutter**, by reading through the [documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/widgets) and watching videos to learn how to create a navbar. Since I wanted to add a navbar to make it easier for users to access the different plans that they have made, I watched this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD1Y2DmL5JM) to learn different concepts, like creating a navbar. Some things that I learned from this video were `.push()` is used to push a new page over the current page and everything that is constant will not be rebuilt even if the page changes.

For my MVP, I have started to create my own navbar. I have created a home page and started to create navigation buttons. My next steps are to add more navigation buttons to the navbar and start creating lists.

I am currently on **Stage 4: Plan the most promising solution** of the Engineering Design Process, where I am still planning and learning my tool, but am also starting to create my MVP. For the next stage, I will start to add more to my MVP.

One skill that I grew in is **how to learn** because I was still learning new concepts in Flutter and also going over on concepts that I have already learned, but didn't quite understand. Another skill that I grew in is **organization** because at first, I didn't really know what my plan was and how I wanted to make my MVP. As I thought more about how I wanted the final product to look like, I watched videos to learn more about concepts that I wanted to use.
